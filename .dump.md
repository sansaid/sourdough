# Notes Dump

For notes that don't have a home yet. Grouped by date to help with creating a timeline, if needed.

* Discussed approach we'll take in building the computer. The objective is to build a small computer that is visually "explainable" and that we can mount on our dining room wall (i.e. also has to be aesthetically pleasing)
* Decided we'll use a breadboard to build this since we want to focus on just the electrical components and not the soldering. Maybe later we'll move on to soldering.
* Will already had prior knowledge of logic gates and how we can build them with transistors through the [SCO book][5], so to facilitate learning, we started by applying that knowledge, looking to external references only to validate assumptions or to fill in gaps
* Explored using from [NAND to Tetris course][3], but this course relies on a hardware simulator to build the computer, which means we may need to incorporate more learning to translate this abstraction into something we can apply to a breadboard - decided against using this course for now
* Decided we'll build the computer using logic gates as the most atomic unit, instead of repeatedly building them since it will make the outcome smaller - we can represent these logic gates with transistors as modules next to the main computer for artistic/explanatory purposes
* Decided the first thing we'll do is build a logic gate using transistors on a mini breadboard so we can learn the mechanics of building on a breadboard. We'll be following the [AND practical guide video for this][1] as well as learnings from [SOC][5]
* Bought basic kit off [Pimoroni][4] to start building a simple logic gate on a breadboard: battery pack, jumper cables, transistors, mini breadboard, LEDs and resistors
* Created a Github project to track rough notes for now, which can be refined later
